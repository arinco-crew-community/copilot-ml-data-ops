-- when I ran it, just having the 4 drop tables as a baseline, then when I typed "create", copilot was creating all the tables.  
-- all subsequent code was generated from comments
-- Including the Language: sql comment prevents Copilot from generating MYSQL code instead of SQL code
-- for data generation, it can give weird code if "using loops" is not added


drop table if exists dbo.comments
drop table if exists dbo.likes
drop table if exists dbo.posts
drop table if exists dbo.users


-- show all tables in the database
-- Language: sql

-- insert 100 random data into all existing tables in the database (users, posts, comments and likes) using loops
