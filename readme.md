# GitHub Copilot Machine Learning & Data Ops Workshop

In this fun workshop, you will learn how to use GitHub Copilot to help you write code for DataOps and Machine Learning tasks.

Estimated time to complete: `10 to 30 minutes`

## Instructions

Inside the `.instructions` folder, you will find a number of markdown files that will guide you through the workshop.

## Machine Learning

[ml-penguin-demo.ipynb](ml-penguin-demo.ipynb) demonstrates that you can use copilot to help you write code for machine learning. Instructions for how to run this are in [ml-penguin-demo-example-output.ipynb](ml-penguin-demo-example-output.ipynb).

Prerequisites:

- `python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip --user`
- `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn --user`

[ml-q&a-demo.ipynb](ml-q&a-demo.ipynb) demonstrates that you can do research using copilot while working.
